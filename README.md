## Practice Ramda

see: http://ramdajs.com/0.21.0/docs/

* `npm i`
* `npm run test`
* `npm run lint`

Modify `src/index.js`; work your way through each test, make the test pass by using the appropriate ramda functions.

* `npm run test`
* remove the leading `x` from each `describe` block, the test will then fail
* write some code to make the test pass
* each function being tested is declared above the test
* making the test pass will require defining the function body and its arguments
